# 👤 User Authentication (Cross-Platform Development)
# CURRENT_USER will be auto-detected from system username if not set
# You can override this for testing different users:
# CURRENT_USER=your.username
AUTHENTICATION_MODE=Environment
AUTHENTICATION_DEFAULT_USER=               # Leave empty to use system username
# CURRENT_USER=                            # Uncomment to override system user detection

# User management settings for development
# - Users can only edit/delete their own entries unless they are "system" user
# - Seed data is created by "system" user and protected from regular user modification
# - For testing, you can set CURRENT_USER to different values to simulate different users
